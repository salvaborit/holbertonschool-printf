# Project: C - printf
##### _by Salvador Borit and Lautaro Illa_
The _printf_ function mirrors the functionalities of the _printf_ function found in the C library included in the _stdio.h_ file, in this case we use these conversion specifiers: c, s, %, d and i.
_Printf_ is a special function, the first argument it receives is fixed and is the format string (the format string is a normal string containing a series of format conversions, each starting with the % character and describing the format to be applied to the corresponding argument).
This _printf_ calls as many parameters as the number of marks included in the format string, plus one that is the format string itself.

## Prototype
```
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
```
# Example
##### #include "main.h"
_printf("I get up every day at %d in the morning and go to %s", 6, "work");

Prints this:
I get up every day at 6 in the morning and go to work.

# Specifiers characteres:
| Specifier | Character |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|  c  |  Character  |
|  s  | String of character  |
|  %  |  Followed by a %, prints another %  |
|  d  |  Print a decimal (base 10) number  |
|  i  |  Print an integer  |
